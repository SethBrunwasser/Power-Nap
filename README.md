# PrivaCV

PrivaCV (Privacy-V) is an application that performs facial recognition to determine which faces in the webcam are authorized to see the information on the computer display. If an unauthorized or unknown face is detected, the screen display will turn off.

Future Developments:
-
- Finalize face-authorizations database
- Add update functionality to continuously add face data while software is in use
