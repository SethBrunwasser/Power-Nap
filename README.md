# Power Nap

Power Nap is an application that uses OpenCV to perform facial recognition to deteremine whwether the screen display should be turned on or off. Power is saved when the user wanders away fromt the computer and the display is turned off. 

Future Project Goals:
- Allow facial ID recognition for the display to only turn on for a specific face id.
- Allow facial ID recognition for the display to turn off if unallowed face ids come into view.
